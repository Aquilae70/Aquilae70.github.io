excerpt: Here is a place for myself to collect some methods in JS or TS etc., which might be ignored or forgotten in daily use.

## JavaScript

1. `Array.indexOf()`, `String.indexOf()`: returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array/string, or -1 if it is not present.
2. `Array(26).fill(0)`: filled length array
3. `Array.from(arrayLike, mapFn)`: static method creates a new, shallow-copied Array instance from an iterable or array-like object.
4. `BigInt()`: represent numeric values which are too large to be represented by the number primitive.

## TypeScript

1. `!`: Post-fix expression operator may be used to assert that its operand is non-null and non-undefined in contexts where the type checker is unable to conclude that fact

## Others

1. `1 ^ 1 == 0`, `0^single_number = single_number`: same numbers have same bits.
